                <h3>Full Game Rules: The Indisputable</h3>
                
                <p>The game begins with each player placing their token on the starting square, launching the application, and selecting a first player. To leave the central square and enter the path, the player freely chooses a theme, selects a difficulty level (Easy, Intermediate, Hard), answers a question, and, if correct, moves forward and chooses which branch of the circle to follow.</p>
                
                <p>Once on the circular path, the theme of each question is automatically determined by the color of the square the player is standing on. During each turn, the player selects a difficulty level, answers a question displayed by the application (with 30 seconds to choose from three options), and then moves forward depending on the chosen difficulty: 1 square for an easy question, 2 for medium, and 3 for hard. If the answer is wrong, the player does not move.</p>

                <p>Some spaces are Chance Squares: if a player lands on one, they must follow the instruction indicated, which may offer an advantage (move forward, bonus) or a disadvantage (move back, lose a turn). The first player to complete a full lap of the circle and return to the center wins the game.</p>
