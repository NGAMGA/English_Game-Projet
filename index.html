                <h3>Full Game Rules: The Indisputable</h3>
                <p><strong>"The Hard Drive"</strong> is an educational board game that uses a mobile application to teach digital culture. The game is played with 2 or more players who each place their token in the center of the board and launch the app; the player with the lowest ping begins.</p>
                <p>Each turn, the app displays a multiple-choice question. At the start of the game, the player freely chooses the theme, but once on the path, the theme is determined by the color of the square their token occupies. The player then chooses a difficulty level (Easy, Intermediate, or Hard), and the app provides a question matching the theme and difficulty. The player has 30 seconds to answer. If the answer is correct, the player moves forward: 1 square for Easy, 2 squares for Intermediate, and 3 squares for Hard; a wrong answer results in no movement.</p>
                <p>Some squares are Chance Squares, which trigger special effects shown on the board or in the app, causing bonuses or penalties such as moving forward, moving back, or losing a turn. The goal is to complete a full lap of the board and return to the center; the first player to do so wins the game.</p>
                <h4>Key elements:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Objective:</strong> The winner is the first player to complete a full lap and return to the Starting Square (center).</li>
                    <li><strong>Required Equipment:</strong> Board, tokens, mobile phone, and the mandatory Digital Add-on (application).</li>
                    <li><strong>Players:</strong> 2 or more. Each player places their token in the center at the start.</li>
                    <li><strong>Turn order:</strong> Determined at game start by lowest ping on the app.</li>
                    <li><strong>Movement:</strong> Correct answers move the token forward: Easy = 1, Intermediate = 2, Hard = 3. Incorrect answers = no movement.</li>
                    <li><strong>Chance Squares:</strong> Trigger instructions (bonus or penalty) shown on the board or in the app (move forward/back, lose a turn, etc.).</li>
